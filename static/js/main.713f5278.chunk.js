Cryptocurrencies come in many forms and varying use cases. Contrary to popular belief, Cryptocurrency is not the first digital currency. Rather it is the first digital currency to use a technology called Cryptography, hence the name crypto-currency.  The first cryptocurrency to successful use Cryptography is what we all know today as Bitcoin. Bitcoin pioneered the path for the digital assets referred to as cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is the most easily recognizable coin and leader in the digital assets class. If you would like to know more about Bitcoin, click here, to visit our detailed summary of what Bitcoin is. Cryptocurrency is often referred to as \u201cCrypto\u201d for short.","### Static   To some, Cryptography is a new phenomenon but in actuality, it is a reliable technology that dates back many many centuries ago. Cryptography is the method of securing a message and being able to privately share the message without it being debunked. The literal translation of cryptography is encrypted writing. So, one could imagine how long ago messages were written in secrete requiring a legend or \u2018key\u2019 to decipher the mismatched letters. Cryptography is a technology that has been adopted and integrated into the digital world to secure the communication of information. Whether that is a message from one entity to another or from one person to the next. Cryptography is the method to securely communicate using mathematical concepts.","### Static   Another fascinating technology just as revolutionary, if not more revolutionary than the integration of cryptography, is the use of blockchain technology. Blockchain is a ledger or book that is distributed amongst a network of computers which is maintained by miners or validators. The premise of Blockchain technology is to verify every transaction on the network as well as record those transactions. Following the validation and confirmation of a transaction on the network, it is recorded as a block and added to a chain of blocks creating the blockchain. This ledger of blocks is maintained over a large network of computers that cannot be accessed from one single point. Making cryptocurrency almost impossible to hack unless you have access to every single computer on the network at the same time. Considering that every transaction on the blockchain is recorded and publicly shared, one would think that blockchain is not and cannot be anonymous. Which goes against the popular belief that cryptocurrency is untraceable. But cryptocurrency largely is still untraceable to a certain degree. Where cryptocurrency can be considered untraceable is because you do not need a bank account, ID or anything more than an online wallet and internet access to operate an account on the blockchain. The blockchain or network of computers records the encrypted transactions by tracking every transaction on the network through the use of Public Keys. But the payments transacted can only be accessed by using the Private Keys mentioned earlier.

What is the benefit of Decentralized Finance versus Centralized Finance? Decentralized finance compared to Centralized finance utilizes cryptocurrency to operate on the blockchain. By moving to a financial system that operates on a blockchain, which as mentioned above is a system of computers that make up a network, you are enabling a more secure and trust less/// seamless movement of funds. Decentralized finance takes out the middle man that the centralized finance system relays on. With the centralized finance system, one has to wait for funds to clear before they are accessible. Where with using the decentralized finance system, one has immediate access to their funds. Where this comes into to play is that one time you are making a purchase outside of your norm, but it actually is you. But you have to wait for the bank to verify and release your funds which can take an unknown amount of time. as long as you have internet access The simple answer is, that cryptocurrency enables liberty and equality. When considering the needs to open an online wallet is only access to the internet Considering one only needs an online wallet and access to the internet to be able to operate on the blockchain, you would not need to be apart of a centralized financial system to access the funds and services that cryptocurrency aims to provide. One would not need to be apart of a financial system that prejudices against what they have or may not have.Rather the system is governed by the validators of the blockchain, which is any computer on the network. //// Cryptocurrency is decentralized so it is not able to be governed by one entity, rather it is governed by the people.

But within the world of cryptocurrencies, there are two main categories, Coins and Tokens. What are cryptocurrency Coins? Cryptocurrency coins are assets that belong to a native blockchain. Similar to how XRP coin belongs to the XRPL or XRP Ledger. Another example is ETH coin which is native to the Ethereum Blockchain. Cryptocurrency coins are the utility coins of their native blockchain. The coins generally facility transactions and fees for their native blockchains. Cryptocurrency tokens are like coins but they are a token that is issued on top of a native blockchain. For example, DOGE is a token built on the ETH blockchain. DOGE is not the native asset to the Ethereum considering ETH is the native asset. Tokens act like coins but do not carry the same utility as coins.

For example, XRP has a potential use case of facilitating bank transactions similar to SWIFT payment system. Also, XLM\u2019s use case is to facilitate person to person transactions. Other use cases could be the need for blockchain storage which is where coins like STORJ or SC - SiaCoin come into play. There are many different and varying uses for cryptocurrency.","### Static   Interoperability, scalability and security are the three main reasons as to why cryptocurrency should be valued over other digital currencies. As mentioned above, the integration of cryptography into the blockchain world is extremely revolutionary when it comes to financial security. Cryptography eliminates the ability for financial systems to be hacked and false transactions implemented into the system. Interoperability is one thing that the blockchain and cryptocurrency community are working to integrate. Interoperability is the ability for a coin or token to move across blockchains while remaining secure. If. A coin or token is able to cross blockchains, that means your funds have the ability to work in many different cases. For example, the SOLO Dex is working to tokenize stocks. If this becomes a reality, one will be able to transact in cryptocurrency while also trading on the stock exchange. Scalability. Blockchain is developing itself to be future proof by over designing the networks to handle extreme amounts of transactions. The FLARE network for example is developing itself to be able to compute hundreds of transactions a second, enabling it to scale to whatever the need is.

For the long term, XLM/USDT does not represent a solid bullish investment. Following the price actions recent rejection at the $0.3994 mark, XLM looks to be on a slippery slow down. But keep yours eyes open for a shift in the MACD Level and Signal indicators if the CCI curls back towards the 0 level,"}),Object(d.jsx)("h2",{className:"references",children:"Referenced Articles:"}),Object(d.jsx)("p",{children:"https://www.tradingview.com"})]})},E=function(){};var F=function(){var e=Object(n.useState)(!1),t=Object(o.a)(e,2),a=t[0],s=t[1];return Object(h.a)("(min-width: 1000px)"),Object(d.jsx)(r.a,{basename:"/cryptovisor-frontend",children:Object(d.jsx)("div",{className:"App",children:Object(d.jsxs)("div",{className:"App-wrapper",children:[Object(d.jsx)("div",{style:{display:"block"}}),Object(d.jsxs)("header",{children:[Object(d.jsx)(m,{click:function(){return s(!0)}}),Object(d.jsx)(y,{show:a,click:function(){return s(!1)}}),Object(d.jsx)(p,{show:a,click:function(){return s(!1)}})]}),Object(d.jsx)("div",{children:Object(d.jsx)(g,{})}),Object(d.jsx)("main",{children:Object(d.jsxs)(l.c,{children:[Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{exact:!0,path:"/",children:Object(d.jsx)(N,{})}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{exact:!0,path:"/Education",children:Object(d.jsx)(S,{})}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{exact:!0,path:"/Education/:coursecontent",children:Object(d.jsx)(C,{})}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{exact:!0,path:"/Education/:coursecontent/:course",children:Object(d.jsx)(T,{})}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{exact:!0,path:"/Analysis",children:Object(d.jsx)(O,{})}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{exact:!0,path:"/Articles/:Article",children:Object(d.jsx)(D,{})}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{exact:!0,path:"/Analysis/:Coin",children:Object(d.jsx)(B,{})}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{component:E})]})}),Object(d.jsx)("div",{children:Object(d.jsx)(j,{})})]})})})},U=a(50),X=a(121),I=Object(U.a)({breakpoints:{values:{xs:0,sm:600,md:900,lg:1200,xl:1536}}});var z=function(){return Object(d.jsx)(X.a,{theme:I,children:Object(d.jsx)(F,{})})},R=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&a.e(3).then(a.bind(null,123)).then((function(t){var a=t.getCLS,n=t.getFID,s=t.getFCP,i=t.getLCP,c=t.getTTFB;a(e),n(e),s(e),i(e),c(e)}))};c.a.render(Object(d.jsx)(s.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(d.jsx)(z,{})}),document.getElementById("root")),R()},63:function(e,t,a){},64:function(e,t,a){},65:function(e,t,a){},66:function(e,t,a){},67:function(e,t,a){},68:function(e,t,a){},77:function(e,t,a){},78:function(e,t,a){},79:function(e,t,a){},80:function(e,t,a){},81:function(e,t,a){},82:function(e,t,a){},83:function(e,t,a){},84:function(e,t,a){}},[[108,1,2]]]);
